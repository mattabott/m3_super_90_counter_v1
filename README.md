# Marui M3 super 90 counter

Hello everyone, this is a little project to upgrade your Marui M3 super 90 shotgun!

I created this project because it's very difficoult to count shots when you play airsoft with a shotgun.
This shotgun fires 3 rounds at a time, and with 30 bbs per shell you have only 10 shots.
So I thought to fix this problem with a raspberry pi pico w, a 3D printer, and a little code.

It's very easy to use, just some little soldering and time, and you will be able to play better with your shotgun!

Starting the counter (pushing batteries) the rp pico will start an hot-spot connection called 'RPI_PICO_AP'.
On your phone, tablet or PC connect to the network with this password: '12345678'. (You can change network name and password in the main.py file)
Now open your browser and go to 192.168.4.1. A web page appear.
