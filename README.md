# Marui M3 super 90 counter

Hello everyone, this is a little project to upgrade your Marui M3 super 90 shotgun!

I created this project because it's very difficoult to count shots when you play airsoft with a shotgun.
This shotgun fires 3 rounds at a time, and with 30 bbs per shell you have only 10 shots.
So I thought to fix this problem with a raspberry pi pico w, a 3D printer, and a little code.

It's very easy to use, just some little soldering and time, and you will be able to play better with your shotgun!
